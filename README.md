# Loan Default Classification

## Tools Used: Python

### Description
This is part of the requirements for completing the Loan Default Prediction with Machine Learning course, which I took as part of the Business Intelligence and Data Analyst (BIDA) certification offered by the Corporate Finance Institute in conjunction with alX.

In this course, I used Python to create a classification algorithm using a logistic regression model with training data aimed based on a number of features to predict which bank customers would default on their loans. 

After creating the model, I tested the model using test data and evaluated performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

This course covers Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn. The completed data is included in an .ipnyb format.
